# Web-Portfolio

This a project with the simple goal of helping me to learn how use express.js with pug in order to dynamicaly generate a portfolio web page to display my web apps and a simple blog.

It should impliment MERN stack along with Sass, and Pug.

Possible Upgrades
1) Blog
  i. Display Comments that have been made on blog posts
  ii. Allow users, who are signed-inn, to create, edite, and delet their own comments.
  

Pipe-Dreams
1) Separate out the Blog(Front-End).
2) Separate out the Blog(Back-End), maybe into a NPM Package that can be implemented by the Portfolio-Site(Back-End).
