FIRST
The reason for creating a blog-app was to learn how to set up a MERN Stack web application, and there 
has been a lot to learn. 
At this point the app is not quite done. The article-display page, which is for composition, editing, and 
displaying article has full back-end support from Express and Mongo. The summery or overview page 
still needs a function that can take the first text blog and filter out all html and then render it down to 
the first X number of words, but other wise it seems to be working with the back end properly.
The ToDo List
*	User account creation / sign-in
*	Implement sessions
*	Configure article- display page to offer editing to admin users
*	Bio-Page; Skills, History, Contac, Certs, Social Media, etc.
Ideas
*	Making all text in app editable by admin users
*	Tracking user interest based on the tags of pages they visit.
